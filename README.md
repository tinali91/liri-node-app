# liri-node-app

In this app, users will be able to search information on various songs, movies, or upcoming concerts. 

Users can pass in one of the following commands:

* concert-this
    * Passing in concert-this followed by an artist will populate the console with upcoming concert dates and locations, if the artist has concerts coming up. 
* spotify-this-song
    * Pass this in followed by a song and it will populate with the song, the artist, the album, and a link to the song on Spotify.
* movie-this
    * This, followed by a movie name, will return details about the movie, including its release date, actors, and movie summary.
* do-what-it-says
    * This will take in text from the random.txt file and run that through the liri node app

All of these commands will return information that will output the data to the "log.txt" file.
